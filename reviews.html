        <h2>Course Reviews</h2>
        <p>Just my thoughts on the various classes I've taken at CMU. Don't just take my word for things, these are subjective opinions more than anything else. I am currently a sophmore.</p>
        <br>

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">18-100</span> <strong>Intro to Electrical and Computer Engineering</strong>
                <p>All ECE first-years are required to take this course. It provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental concepts in the field. The main 
                    feature is the labs, which for the most part were well-designed and fun. The weekly small group sessions were also a good feature for reinforcing 
                    the material. Also, Jimmy Zhu is a great lecturer, and is somewhat of a godfather figure within the ECE department. I would say this class has 
                    been, so far, one of my favorites, and it helped confirm my interest in ECE.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">21-127</span> <strong>Concepts of Mathematics</strong>
                <p>This class is an introduction to discrete/formal math, and covers topic including logic, set theory, number theory, and combinatorics.
                    I found this class to be quite difficult, especially given I had no prior experience with proofs. Some question why this class
                    is required for ECE majors, but I think it provides a strong mathematical foundation, even if you don't end up directly using 
                    discrete math later on.
                </p>

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">21-259</span> <strong>Calculus in 3D</strong>
                <p>A pretty standard Calculus 3 course contentwise. It is mostly computation-based, so take a different class if you want to do serious proofs.
                    For ECE however, this class definitely covers what you need to know.
                </p>

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">76-101</span> <strong>First-Year Writing</strong>
                <p>All first-years are required to take either this course or two of the three available half-semester writing courses. It's a decent but not
                    super rigorous course on academic-level writing. My professor in particular was quite lenient with grading. Each section studies a different 
                    topic, so pick one that interests you!

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">98-012</span> <strong>StuCo: Fun With Robots</strong>
                <p>This was the first StuCo (student-taught course) I took, and I really enjoyed it. You are given a robot kit, and throughout the course, you get 
                    to assemble and program it to complete various challenges. You also get to keep the robot at the end, which is very cool. The content is approachable 
                    and suited for students of all backgrounds. In fact, I enjoyed this class so much I ended up being a TA the following semester, and now I am 
                    one of the instructors.

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">15-122</span> <strong>Principles of Imperative Computation</strong>
                <p>This courses teaches how to think critically about your code, as well as introducing the C programming language and some basic data structures and 
                    algorithms. The content is thorough and decently challenging, but I definitely learned a lot from this course. It's a very well-run ship, and there 
                    are plenty of office hours and resources available to help you succeed. Students have some strong opinions on Iliano as a lecturer, but I personally 
                    thought his lectures were fine.

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">21-241</span> <strong>Matrices and Linear Transformations</strong>
                <p>Like Calculus 3, this is a standard linear algebra class. I do wish there was some more focus on real-world applications instead of just pure 
                    computation.

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">24-101</span> <strong>Fundamentals of Mechanical Engineering</strong>
                <p>Students in the engineering college must choose a second engineering intro course, so I took this one. It gave a solid overivew of the fundamentals, 
                    and some of Professor Aksak's lectures were interesting (particularly when he was discussing his research). I did like that they taught us some basic CAD and rapid prototyping skills. However, if you have prior 
                    experience with CAD or programming, the labs can feel a bit basic.</p>

            <div class="review-item">
                <span class="course-code">85-107</span> <strong>The Psychology of Video Games</strong>
                <p>This was a fun class. It explored the psychological principles behind game design and player engagement, as well as some concepts from experimental 
                    psychology. And, you literally get to play video games for some of the assignments! Erik Thiessen is a great professor, and does a fantastic job 
                    of making the material engaging. I highly recommend this course, even if you aren't a fan of video games.
